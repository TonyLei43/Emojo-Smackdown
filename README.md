### Prepare to Play
1. Position yourself in front of your device’s camera. Make sure your hand is visible to the camera.
2. Decide on your move (Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock). Hold your chosen move in front of the camera:

- For Rock: Make a fist.
- For Paper: Hold your hand flat.
- For Scissors: Show a peace sign.
- For Lizard: Make a sock-puppet shape with your hand.
- For Spock: Make a V-shape with your fingers (like the Vulcan salute).

3. When you’re ready, click the “Capture” button. Keep your move steady and clear for the camera.

4. After you capture your move, the computer will randomly generate its move.

5. The game will compare your move with the computer’s move. The result will be displayed on the screen, showing whether you won, lost, or tied.

6. To play another round, simply choose a new move and click “Capture” again.

Remember, have fun and may the best move win!
